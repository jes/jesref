<h2 id="cha:kinematics">1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>When we talk about CNC machines, we usually think about machines that
are commanded to move to certain locations and perform various tasks.
In order to have an unified view of the machine space, and to make it
fit the human point of view over 3D space, most of the machines (if not
all) use a common coordinate system called the Cartesian Coordinate
System.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Cartesian Coordinate system is composed of three axes (X, Y, Z) each
perpendicular to the other two. <span class="footnote"><br />[The word “axes” is also
commonly (and wrongly) used when talking about
CNC machines, and referring to the moving directions of the machine.]<br /></span></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When we talk about a G-code program (RS274/NGC) we talk about a number
of commands (G0, G1, etc.) which have positions as parameters (X- Y-
Z-). These positions refer exactly to Cartesian positions. Part of the
LinuxCNC motion controller is responsible for translating those positions
into positions which correspond to the machine
kinematics. <span class="footnote"><br />[Kinematics: a two way function to
transform from Cartesian space to joint space]<br /></span></p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_joints_vs_axes">1.1. Joints vs. Axes</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A joint of a CNC machine is a one of the physical degrees of freedom
of the machine. This might be linear (leadscrews) or rotary (rotary
tables, robot arm joints). There can be any number of joints on a
given machine. For example, one popular robot has 6 joints, and a
typical simple milling machine has only 3.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are certain machines where the joints are laid out to match
kinematics axes (joint 0 along axis X, joint 1 along axis Y, joint 2
along axis Z), and these machines are called Cartesian machines (or machines with Trivial Kinematics). These are the most common machines
used in milling, but are not very common in other domains of machine
control (e.g. welding: puma-typed robots).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>LinuxCNC supports axes with names: X Y Z A B C U V W.  The X Y Z axes
typically refer to the usual Cartesian coordinates. The A B C axes refer to
rotational coordinates about the X Y Z axes respectively.  The U V W axes refer to
additional coordinates that are commonly made colinear to the X Y Z axes respectively.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_trivial_kinematics">2. Trivial Kinematics</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The simplest machines are those in which which each joint is placed
along one of the Cartesian axes. On these machines the mapping from
Cartesian space (the G-code program) to the joint space (the actual
actuators of the machine) is trivial. It is a simple 1:1 mapping:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>pos-&gt;tran.x = joints[0];
pos-&gt;tran.y = joints[1];
pos-&gt;tran.z = joints[2];</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the above code snippet one can see how the mapping is done: the X
position is identical with the joint 0, the Y position with
joint 1, etc. The above refers to the direct kinematics (one
direction of the transformation).
The next code snippet refers to the inverse kinematics (or the
inverse direction of the transformation):</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>joints[0] = pos-&gt;tran.x;
joints[1] = pos-&gt;tran.y;
joints[2] = pos-&gt;tran.z;</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In LinuxCNC, the identity kinematics are implemented with the
<em>trivkins</em> kinematics module and extended to 9 axes.  The default
relationships between axis coordinates and joint numbers are:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>pos-&gt;tran.x = joints[0];
pos-&gt;tran.y = joints[1];
pos-&gt;tran.z = joints[2];
pos-&gt;a      = joints[3];
pos-&gt;b      = joints[4];
pos-&gt;c      = joints[5];
pos-&gt;u      = joints[6];
pos-&gt;v      = joints[7];
pos-&gt;w      = joints[8];</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Similarly, the default relationships for inverse kinematics for trivkins
are:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>joints[0] = pos-&gt;tran.x;
joints[1] = pos-&gt;tran.y;
joints[2] = pos-&gt;tran.z;
joints[3] = pos-&gt;a;
joints[4] = pos-&gt;b;
joints[5] = pos-&gt;c;
joints[6] = pos-&gt;u;
joints[7] = pos-&gt;v;
joints[8] = pos-&gt;w;</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is straightforward to do the transformation for a trivial "kins" (<em>trivkins</em>
kinematics) or Cartesian machine provided that there are no omissions in the
axis letters used.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It gets a bit more complicated if the machine is missing one or more of the
axis letters.  The problems of omitted axis letters is addressed by using the
<em>coordinates=</em> module parameter with the trivkins module.  Joint numbers are
assigned consecutively to each coordinate specified.  A lathe can be described
with <em>coordinates=xz</em> The joint assignments will then be:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>joints[0] = pos-&gt;tran.x
joints[1] = pos-&gt;tran.z</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Use of the <em>coordinates=</em> parameter is recommended for configurations that omit
axis letters. <span class="footnote"><br />[ Historically, the trivkins module did not support the
<em>coordinates=</em> parameter so lathe configs were often configured as XYZ
machines.  The unused Y axis was configured to 1) home immediately, 2) use a
simple loopback to connect its position command hal pin to its position
feedback hal pin, and 3) hidden in gui displays.   Numerous sim configs use
these methods in order to share common hal files.]<br /></span></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>trivkins</em> kinematics module also allows the same coordinate to be specified
for more than one joint.  This feature can be useful on machines like a gantry
having two independent motors for the y coordinate.  Such a machine could use
<em>coordinates=xyyz</em> resulting in joint assignments:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>joints[0] = pos-&gt;tran.x
joints[1] = pos-&gt;tran.y
joints[2] = pos-&gt;tran.y
joints[3] = pos-&gt;tran.z</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>See the trivkins man pages for more information.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_non_trivial_kinematics">3. Non-trivial kinematics</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>There can be quite a few types of machine setups (robots: puma, scara;
hexapods etc.). Each of them is set up using linear and rotary joints.
These joints don&#8217;t usually match with the Cartesian coordinates,
therefore we need a kinematics function which does the
conversion (actually 2 functions: forward and inverse kinematics
function).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To illustrate the above, we will analyze a simple kinematics called
bipod (a simplified version of the tripod, which is a simplified
version of the hexapod).</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/bipod.png" alt="Bipod setup" />
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Bipod setup</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Bipod we are talking about is a device that consists of 2 motors
placed on a wall, from which a device is hung using some wire. The
joints in this case are the distances from the motors to the device
(named AD and BD in the figure).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The position of the motors is fixed by convention. Motor A is in
(0,0), which means that its X coordinate is 0, and its Y coordinate is
also 0. Motor B is placed in (Bx, 0), which means that its X coordinate
is Bx.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Our tooltip will be in point D which gets defined by the distances AD
and BD, and by the Cartesian coordinates Dx, Dy.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The job of the kinematics is to transform from joint lengths (AD, BD)
to Cartesian coordinates (Dx, Dy) and vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_forward_transformation">3.1. Forward transformation</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To transform from joint space into Cartesian space we will use some
trigonometry rules (the right triangles determined by the points (0,0),
(Dx,0), (Dx,Dy) and the triangle (Dx,0), (Bx,0) and (Dx,Dy).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We can easily see that:
<span class="image">
<img src="images/kinematics-math-01.png" alt="images/kinematics-math-01.png" />
</span>,
likewise:
<span class="image">
<img src="images/kinematics-math-02.png" alt="images/kinematics-math-02.png" />
</span></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If we subtract one from the other we will get:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/kinematics-math-03.png" alt="images/kinematics-math-03.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and therefore:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/kinematics-math-04.png" alt="images/kinematics-math-04.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>From there we calculate:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/kinematics-math-05.png" alt="images/kinematics-math-05.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that the calculation for y involves the square root of a
difference, which may not result in a real number. If there is no
single Cartesian coordinate for this joint position, then the position
is said to be a singularity. In this case, the forward kinematics
return -1.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Translated to actual code:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>double AD2 = joints[0] * joints[0];
double BD2 = joints[1] * joints[1];
double x = (AD2 - BD2 + Bx * Bx) / (2 * Bx);
double y2 = AD2 - x * x;
if(y2 &lt; 0) return -1;
pos-&gt;tran.x = x;
pos-&gt;tran.y = sqrt(y2);
return 0;</code></pre>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_inverse_transformation">3.2. Inverse transformation</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The inverse kinematics is lots easier in our example, as we can write
it directly:</p></div>
