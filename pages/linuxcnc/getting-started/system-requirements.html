<h2 id="cha:system-requirements">1. Minimum Requirements</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The minimum system to run LinuxCNC and Debian / Ubuntu may vary depending
on the exact usage. Stepper systems in general require faster threads to
generate step pulses than servo systems. You can use the Live-CD to test
the software before committing to a permanent installation on a computer.
Keep in mind that the Latency Test numbers are more important than the
processor speed for software step generation. More information on the
Latency Test is <a href="../config/stepconf.html#latency-test">here</a>.
In addition LinuxCNC needs to be run on an operating system that uses a
specially modified kernel. See <a href="system-requirements.html#kernel_and_version_requirements">Kernel and Version Requirements</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Additional information is on the LinuxCNC Wiki site:
<a href="http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Hardware_Requirements">Hardware Requirements</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>LinuxCNC and Debian Linux should run reasonably well on a computer with
the following minimum hardware specification. These numbers are not the
absolute minimum but will give reasonable performance for most stepper
systems.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
700 MHz x86 processor (1.2 GHz x86 processor recommended) or Raspberry
  Pi 4 or better.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
To run LinuxCNC 2.8 and Debian Buster from the LiveCD the system should
  be 64-bit capable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
512 MB or more of RAM
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
8 GB hard disk
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Graphics card capable of at least 1024x768 resolution, which is not
   using the NVidia or ATI fglrx proprietary drivers. Modern onboard
   graphic chipsets seem to generally be OK.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A network or Internet connection (not strictly needed, but very useful
  for updates and for communicating with the LinuxCNC community)
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Minimum hardware requirements change as Linux distributions evolve so
check the <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch02.en.html">Debian</a>
web site for details on the LiveCD you&#8217;re using. Older hardware may
benefit from selecting an older version of the LiveCD when available.</p></div>
</div>

<h2 id="kernel_and_version_requirements">2. Kernel and Version requirements</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>LinuxCNC requires a kernel modified for realtime use to control real
machine hardware. It can, however run on a standard kernel in simulation
mode for purposes such as checking G-code, testing config files and
learning the system.
To work with these kernel versions there are two versions of LinuxCNC
distributed. The package names are "linuxcnc" and "linuxcnc-uspace"</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The realtime kernel options are preempt-rt, RTAI and Xenomai.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can discover the kernel version of your system with the command</p></div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>uname -a</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you see (as above) <code>-rt-</code> in the kernel name then you are running the
preempt-rt kernel and should install the "uspace" version of linuxcnc.
You should also install uspace for "sim" configs on non-realtime kernels</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you see <code>-rtai-</code> in the kernel name then you are running RTAI
realtime. See below for the linuxcnc version to install.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_preempt_rt_with_linuxcnc_uspace">2.1. Preempt-RT with linuxcnc-uspace</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Preempt-RT is the newst of the realtime systems, and is also the version
that is closest to a mainline kernel. Preempt-RT kernels are available
as precompiled packages from the main repositories. The search term
"PREEMPT_RT" will find them, and one can be downloaded and installed
just like any other package.
Preempt-RT will generally have the best driver support and is the only
option for systems using the Mesa ethernet-connected hardware driver
cards. In general preempt-rt has the worst latency of the available
systems, but there are exceptions.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_rtai_with_linuxcnc">2.2. RTAI with linuxcnc</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>RTAI has been the mainstay of LinuxCNC distributions for many years. It
will generally give the best realtime performance in terms of low
latency, but might have poorer peripheral support and not as many screen
resolutions. An RTAI kernel is available from the LinuxCNC package
repository. If you installed from the Live/Install image then switching
kernel and LinuxCNC flavour is described in [Installing-RTAI].</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_xenomai_with_linuxcnc_uspace">2.3. Xenomai with linuxcnc-uspace</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Xenomai is also supported, but you will have to find or build the kernel
and compile LinuxCNC from source to utilise it.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_rtai_with_linuxcnc_uspace">2.4. RTAI with linuxcnc-uspace</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is also possible to run linuxCNC with RTAI in user-space mode. As
with Xenomai you will need to compile from source to do this.</p></div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_problematic_hardware">3. Problematic Hardware</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_laptops">3.1. Laptops</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Laptops are not generally suited to real time software step
generation. Again a Latency Test run for an extended time will give you
the info you need to determine suitability.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_video_cards">3.2. Video Cards</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If your installation pops up with 800 x 600 screen resolution then
most likely Debian does not recognize your video card or monitor. This
can sometimes be worked-around by installing drivers or creating /
editing Xorg.conf files.</p></div>
