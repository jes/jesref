<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">hm2_eth is a
device driver that interfaces Mesa&rsquo;s ethernet based
Anything I/O boards (with the HostMot2 firmware) to the
LinuxCNC HAL.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The supported
boards are: 7I76E, 7I80DB, 7I80HD, 7I92, 7I93, 7I94, 7I95,
7I96, 7I96S, 7I97, 7I98.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The board must
have its hardware loaded on the board by the mesaflash(1)
program.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">hm2_eth is only
available when linuxcnc is configured with
&quot;uspace&quot; realtime.</p>

<h2>INTERFACE CONFIGURATION
<a name="INTERFACE CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">hm2_eth should
be used on a dedicated network interface, with only a cable
between the PC and the board. Wireless and USB network
interfaces are not suitable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
instructions assume your dedicated network interface is
&quot;eth1&quot;, 192.168.1/24 is an unused private network,
that the hostmot2 board is using the default address of
192.168.1.121, that you are using Debian 7 or similar, and
that you do not otherwise use iptables. If any of these are
false, you will need to modify the instructions accordingly.
After following all the instructions, reboot so that the
changes take effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is
particularly important to check that the network
192.168.1/24 is not already the private network used by your
internet router, because this is a commonly-used value. If
you use another network, you will also need to reconfigure
the hostmot2 card to use an IP address on that network by
using the mesaflash(1) utility and change jumper settings.
Typically, you will choose one of the networks in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Private_networks">Private
IPv4 address space.</a> One common alternative is PC address
10.10.10.1, hostmot2 address 10.10.10.10.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Use of the
dedicated ethernet interface while linuxcnc is running can
cause violation of realtime guarantees. hm2_eth will
automatically mitigate most accidental causes of
interference.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Configure
network with static address</b> <br>
Add these lines to the file /etc/network/interfaces to
configure eth1 with a static address:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">auto eth1 <br>
iface eth1 inet static <br>
address 192.168.1.1 <br>
hardware-irq-coalesce-rx-usecs 0</p>

<h2>PACKET LOSS
<a name="PACKET LOSS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">While ethernet
is fairly resistant to electrical noise, many systems will
not have 100% perfect packet reception. The hm2_eth driver
has a limited ability to deal with lost packets. Packet loss
is detected by transmitting an expected read or write packet
count with each request, and checking the value with each
read response. When a lost packet is detected, the
<b>packet-error</b> pin is asserted in that cycle, the
<b>packet-error-level</b> pin is increased, and if it
reaches a threshold then a permanent low-level I/O error is
signaled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">However, not
all hm2 special functions know how to properly recover from
lost packets. For instance, the encoder special function
does not properly manage the index feature when packets are
lost. The author believes that this can lead to rare
failures in home-to-index, which can have severe
consequences.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the other
hand, pid-stepper systems will run properly for extended
periods of time with packet loss on the order of .01%, as
long as following error is increased enough that having
stale position feedback does not trigger a following error.
Altering the HAL configuration so that during transient
packet loss the pid and motion feedback value is equal to
the command value, instead of the stale feedback value,
appears to improve tuning. This can be accomplished with a
<b>mux2(9)</b> component for each feedback signal, using
<b>packet-error</b> as the mux2 <b>sel</b> input.</p>

<h2>PINS
<a name="PINS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the pins documented in <b>hostmot2(9)</b>, <b>hm2_eth(9)</b>
creates additional pins: <br>
(bit, out)
hm2_<i>&lt;BoardType&gt;</i>.<i>&lt;BoardNum&gt;</i>.packet-error</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This pin is TRUE when the most
recent cycle detected a read or write error, and FALSE at
other times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(s32, out)
hm2_<i>&lt;BoardType&gt;</i>.<i>&lt;BoardNum&gt;</i>.packet-error-level</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This pin shows the current
error level, with higher numbers indicating a greater number
of recent detected errors. The error level is always in the
range from 0 to packet-error-limit, inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(bit, out)
hm2_<i>&lt;BoardType&gt;</i>.<i>&lt;BoardNum&gt;</i>.packet-error-exceeded</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This pin is TRUE when the
current error level is equal to the maximum, and FALSE at
other times.</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS
<a name="PARAMETERS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
the parameters documented in <b>hostmot2(9)</b>,
<b>hm2_eth(9)</b> creates additional parameters: <br>
(s32, rw)
hm2_<i>&lt;BoardType&gt;</i>.<i>&lt;BoardNum&gt;</i>.packet-error-decrement</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The amount deducted from
<i>packet-error-level</i> in a cycle without detected read
or write errors, without going below zero.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(s32, rw)
hm2_<i>&lt;BoardType&gt;</i>.<i>&lt;BoardNum&gt;</i>.packet-error-increment</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The amount added to
<i>packet-error-level</i> in a cycle without detected read
or write errors, without going above packet-error-limit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(s32, rw)
hm2_<i>&lt;BoardType&gt;</i>.<i>&lt;BoardNum&gt;</i>.packet-error-limit</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The level at which a detected
read or write error is treated as a permament error. When
this error level is reached, the board&rsquo;s
<i>io-error</i> pin becomes TRUE and the condition must be
manually reset.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">(s32, rw)
hm2_<i>&lt;BoardType&gt;</i>.<i>&lt;BoardNum&gt;</i>.packet-read-timeout</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The length of time that must
pass before a read request times out. If the value is less
than or equal to 0, it is interpreted as 80% of the thread
period. If the value is less than 100, it is interpreted as
a percentage of the thread period. Otherwise, it is
interpreted as a time in nanoseconds. In any case, the
timeout is never less than 100 microseconds.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Setting this
value too low can cause spurious read errors. Setting it too
high can cause realtime delay errors.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">hm2_eth uses an
iptables chain called &quot;hm2-eth-rules-output&quot; to
control access to the network interface while hal is
running. The chain is created if it does not exist, and a
jump to it is inserted at the beginning of the OUTPUT chain
if it is not there already. If you have an existing iptables
setup, you can insert a direct jump from OUTPUT to
hm2-eth-rules-output in an order appropriate to your local
network.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">At (normal)
exit, hm2_eth will remove the rules. After a crash, you can
manually clear the rules with <b>sudo iptables -F
hm2-eth-rules-output</b>; the rules are also removed by a
reboot.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">&quot;hardware-irq-coalesce-rx-usecs&quot;
decreases time waiting to receive a packet on most systems,
but on at least some Marvel-chipset NICs it is harmful. If
the line does not improve system performance, then remove
it. A reboot is required for the value to be set back to its
power-on default. This requires the ethtool package to be
installed.</p>

<h2>BUGS
<a name="BUGS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some hostmot2
functions such uart are coded in a way that causes
additional latency when used with hm2_eth.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On the 7i92,
the HAL pins for the LEDs are called CR01..CR04, but the
silkscreens are CR3..CR6. Depending on the FPGA firmware,
the LEDs may initially be under control of the ethernet
engine. This can be changed until power cycle with</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">elbpcom
01D914000000</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Depending on
firmware version, this driver may cause the hardware error
LED to light even though the driver and hardware are
functioning normally. This will reportedly be fixed in
future bitfile updates from Mesa.</p>
