<div class="paragraph" id="cha:latency-test"><p>This test is the first test that should be performed on a PC
to see if it is able to drive a CNC machine.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Latency is how long it takes the PC to stop what it is doing and
respond to an external request. For LinuxCNC the request is
BASE_THREAD that makes the periodic <em>heartbeat</em> that serves as a
timing reference for the step pulses. The lower the latency, the
faster you can run the heartbeat, and the faster and smoother the
step pulses will be.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Latency is far more important than CPU speed.
A lowly Pentium II that responds to interrupts within 10 microseconds
each and every time can give better results
than the latest and fastest P4 Hyperthreading beast.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The CPU isn&#8217;t the only factor in determining latency.
Motherboards, video cards, USB ports, and
a number of other things can hurt the latency.
The best way to find out what you are dealing with is
to run the RTAI latency test.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Generating step pulses in software
has one very big advantage - it&#8217;s free.
Just about every PC has a parallel port that is
capable of outputting step pulses that are generated by the software.
However, software step pulses
also have some disadvantages:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
limited maximum step rate
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
jitter in the generated pulses
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
loads the CPU
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The best way to find out how well your PC will lrun LinuxCNC
is to run the HAL latency test.
To run the test, open a terminal window
(In Ubuntu, from Applications → Accessories → Terminal)
and run the following command:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>latency-test</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You should see something like this:</p></div>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. HAL Latency Test</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>While the test is running, you should <em>abuse</em> the computer.
Move windows around on the screen. Surf the web. Copy some large files
around on the disk. Play some music.
Run an OpenGL program such as glxgears.
The idea is to put the PC through its paces while
the latency test checks to see what the worst case numbers are.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The important number for software stepping is the <em>max jitter</em> of the base thread.
In the example above, that is 6693 nanoseconds, or 6.693 microseconds.
Record this number, and enter it in Stepconf when it is requested.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the example above, latency-test only ran for a few seconds.
You should run the test for at least several minutes; sometimes
the worst case latency doesn&#8217;t happen very often, or only happens
when you do some particular action. For instance, one Intel
motherboard worked pretty well most of the time, but every 64
seconds it had a very bad 300 us latency. Fortunately that was
fixable, see <a href="http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FixingSMIIssues">http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?FixingSMIIssues</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, what do the results mean? If your Max Jitter number is less
than about 15-20 microseconds (15000-20000 nanoseconds), the
computer should give very nice results with software stepping. If
the max latency is more like 30-50 microseconds, you can still
get good results, but your maximum step rate might be a little
disappointing, especially if you use microstepping or have very
fine pitch leadscrews. If the numbers are 100 us or more (100,000
nanoseconds), then the PC is not a good candidate for software
stepping. Numbers over 1 millisecond (1,000,000 nanoseconds) mean
the PC is not a good candidate for LinuxCNC, regardless of whether you
use software stepping or not.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that if you get high numbers, there may be ways to improve
them. Another PC had very bad latency (several milliseconds) when
using the onboard video. But a $5 used video card solved the
problem.</p></div>

Notes:
  Linuxcnc and Hal should not be running, stop with halrun -U.
  Large number of bins and/or small binsizes will slow updates.
  For single thread, specify --nobase (and options for servo thread).
  Measured latencies outside of the +/- bin range are reported
  with special end bars.  Use --show to show count for
  the off-chart [pos|neg] bin</code></pre>
