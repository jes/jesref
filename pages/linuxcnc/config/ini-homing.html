<div class="paragraph"><p>Homing sets the zero origin of the G53 machine coordinates.<br />
Soft limits are defined relative to the machine origin.<br />
The soft limits automatically decelerate and stop the axes before they hits the limits switches<br />
A properly setup and functioning machine will not move beyond soft(ware) limits and<br />
will have the machine origin set as repeatable as the home switch/index mechanism is.<br />
Linuxcnc can be  homed by eye (alignment marks), with switches, with switches and encoder index, or use absolute encoders.<br />
Homing seems simple enough - just move each joint to a known location,
and set LinuxCNC&#8217;s internal variables accordingly.<br />
However, different machines have different requirements, and homing is actually quite
complicated.</p></div>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Homing relies on some fundamental machine assumptions.<br /></p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The negative and positive directions are based on <a href="../user/user-concepts.html#sec:Machine-Configurations">Tool Movement</a> which can be different<br />
then the actual machine movement. ie on a mill typically the table moves rather then the tool.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Everything is referenced from the G53 machine zero origin, the origin can be anywhere (even outside where you can move)<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The G53 machine zero origin is typically inside the soft limits area but not necessarily.<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The homing switch offset sets where the origin is, but even it is referenced from the origin.<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When using encoder index homing, the home switch offset is calculated from the encoder reference position, after the home switch has been tripped.<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The negative soft(ware) limits are the most you can move in the negative direction after homing.<br />
(but they might not be negative in the absolute sense)<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The positive soft(ware) limits are the most you can move in the positive direction after homing.<br />
(but they might not be positive in the absolute sense, though it is usual to set it as a positive number)<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Soft(ware) limits are inside the limit switch area.<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
(Final) Homed Position is inside the soft limit area<br />
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
(If using switch based homing) the homing switch(es) either utilize the limit switches (shared home / limit switch),<br />
or when using a separate home switch, are inside the limit switch area.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If using a separate homing switch, it&#8217;s possible to start homing on the wrong side of the home switch,<br />
which combined with HOME_IGNORE_LIMITS option will lead to a hard crash.<br />
You can avoid this by making the home switch toggle it&#8217;s state when the trip dog is on a particular side until it returns passed the trip point again.<br />
Said another way, the home switch state must represent the position of the dog relative to the switch (ie <em>before</em> or <em>after</em> the switch),<br />
and must stay that way even if the dog coasts past the switch in the same direction.

<h3 id="_home_search_vel">6.1. HOME_SEARCH_VEL </h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This variable has units of machine-units per second.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The default value is zero. A value of zero causes LinuxCNC to assume that
there is no home switch; the search stage of homing is skipped.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If HOME_SEARCH_VEL is non-zero, then LinuxCNC assumes that there is a home
switch. It begins by checking whether the home switch is already
tripped. If tripped it backs off the switch at HOME_SEARCH_VEL. The
direction of the back-off is opposite the sign of HOME_SEARCH_VEL. Then
it searches for the home switch by moving in the direction specified by
the sign of HOME_SEARCH_VEL, at a speed determined by its absolute
value. When the home switch is detected, the joint will stop as fast as
possible, but there will always be some overshoot. The amount of
overshoot depends on the speed. If it is too high, the joint might
overshoot enough to hit a limit switch or crash into the end of travel.
On the other hand, if HOME_SEARCH_VEL is too low, homing can take a
long time.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_home_latch_vel">6.2. HOME_LATCH_VEL </h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This variable has units of machine-units per second.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Specifies the speed and direction that LinuxCNC uses when it makes its
final accurate determination of the home switch (if present) and index
pulse location (if present). It will usually be slower than the search
velocity to maximize accuracy. If HOME_SEARCH_VEL and HOME_LATCH_VEL
have the same sign, then the latch phase is done while moving in the
same direction as the search phase. (In that case, LinuxCNC first backs off
the switch, before moving towards it again at the latch velocity.) If
HOME_SEARCH_VEL and HOME_LATCH_VEL have opposite signs, the latch phase
is done while moving in the opposite direction from the search phase.
That means LinuxCNC will latch the first pulse after it moves off the
switch. If HOME_SEARCH_VEL is zero (meaning there is no home switch),
and this parameter is nonzero, LinuxCNC goes ahead to the index pulse
search. If HOME_SEARCH_VEL is non-zero and this parameter is zero, it
is an error and the homing operation will fail. The default value is
zero.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_home_final_vel">6.3. HOME_FINAL_VEL</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This variable has units of machine-units per second.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It specifies the speed that LinuxCNC uses when it makes its move from
HOME_OFFSET to the HOME position. If the HOME_FINAL_VEL is missing from
the ini file, then the maximum joint speed is used to make this move.
The value must be a positive number.</p></div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_home_ignore_limits">6.4. HOME_IGNORE_LIMITS </h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Can hold the values YES / NO. The default value for this parameter is NO.
This flag determines whether LinuxCNC will ignore the limit switch input
for this joint while homing. This setting will not ignore limit inputs
for other joints. If you do not have a separate home switch set this to YES and
connect the limit switch signal to the joint home switch input in HAL. LinuxCNC
will ignore the limit switch input for this joint while homing. To use only
one input for all homing and limits you will have to block the limit signals
of the joints not homing in HAL and home one joint at a time.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_home_use_index">6.5. HOME_USE_INDEX </h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Specifies whether or not there is an index pulse. If the flag is true
(HOME_USE_INDEX = YES), LinuxCNC will latch on the rising edge of the index
pulse. If false, LinuxCNC will latch on either the rising or falling edge of
the home switch (depending on the signs of HOME_SEARCH_VEL and
HOME_LATCH_VEL). The default value is NO.</p></div>

process. The default value is zero. Note that even if this parameter is the
same as HOME_OFFSET, the joint will slightly overshoot the latched position as
it stops. Therefore there will always be a small move at this time (unless
HOME_SEARCH_VEL is zero, and the entire search/latch stage was skipped). This
final move will be made at the joint&#8217;s maximum velocity unless HOME_FINAL_VEL has

<div class="paragraph"><p>A hal pin (motion.homing-inhibit) is provided to disallow
homing initiation for both "Home All" and individual joint
homing.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some systems take advantage of the provisions for synchronizing
final joint homing moves as controlled by negative
[JOINT_N]HOME_SEQUENCE= ini file items.  By default, the
synchronization provisions disallow <strong>joint</strong> jogging prior to
homing in order to prevent <strong>joint</strong> jogs that could misalign the
machine (gantry racking for example).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>System integrator can allow <strong>joint</strong> jogging prior to homing with
hal logic that switches the [JOINT_N]HOME_SEQUENCE items.  This
logic should also assert the <strong>motion.homing-inhibit</strong> pin to ensure
that homing is not inadvertently initiated when <strong>joint</strong> jogging
is enabled.</p></div>
