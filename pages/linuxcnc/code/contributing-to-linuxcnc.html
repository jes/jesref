<h2 id="_introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>This document contains information for developers about LinuxCNC
infrastructure, and describes the best practices for contributing code
and documentation updates to the LinuxCNC project.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Throughout this document, "source" means both the source code to the
programs and libraries, and the source text for the documentation.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_communication_among_linuxcnc_developers">2. Communication among LinuxCNC developers</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The two main ways that project developers communicate with each other are:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Via IRC, at #linuxcnc-devel on FreeNode.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Via email, on the developers' mailing list:
  <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/emc-developers">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/emc-developers</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_linuxcnc_source_forge_project">3. The LinuxCNC Source Forge project</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>We use Source Forge for mailing lists: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/emc/mailman/">http://sourceforge.net/p/emc/mailman/</a></p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_git_revision_control_system">4. The git Revision Control System</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>All of the LinuxCNC source is maintained in the revision control system
git <span class="footnote"><br />[<a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a>]<br /></span>.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_linuxcnc_official_git_repo">4.1. LinuxCNC official git repo</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The official LinuxCNC git repo is at <a href="http://github.com/linuxcnc/linuxcnc/">http://github.com/linuxcnc/linuxcnc/</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Anyone can get a read-only copy of the LinuxCNC source tree via git:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>git clone https://github.com/linuxcnc/linuxcnc linuxcnc-dev</code></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you are a developer with push access, then follow github&#8217;s instructions
for setting up a repository that you can push from.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that the clone command put the local LinuxCNC repo in a
directory called <code>linuxcnc-dev</code>, instead of the default <code>linuxcnc</code>.
This is because the LinuxCNC software by default expects configs and
G-code programs in a directory called <code>$HOME/linuxcnc</code>, and having the
git repo there too is confusing.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Issues and pull requests are welcome on github:
<a href="https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc/issues">https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc/issues</a>
<a href="https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc/pulls">https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc/pulls</a></p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_use_of_git_in_the_linuxcnc_project">4.2. Use of git in the LinuxCNC project</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We use the "merging upwards" and "topic branches" git workflows described
here:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitworkflows.html">https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitworkflows.html</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We have a development branch called <code>master</code>, and one or more stable
branches with names like <code>2.6</code> and <code>2.7</code> indicating the version number
of the releases we make from it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Bugfixes go in the oldest applicable stable branch, and that branch gets
merged into the next newer stable branch, and so on up to <code>master</code>.
The committer of the bugfix may do the merges themselves, or they may
leave the merges for someone else.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>New features generally go in the <code>master</code> branch, but some kinds of
features (specifically well isolated device drivers and documentation)
may (at the discretion of the stable branch release managers) go into
a stable branch and get merged up just like bugfixes do.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_git_tutorials">4.3. git tutorials</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are many excellent, free git tutorials on the internet.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The first place to look is probably the "gittutorial" manpage.
This manpage is accessible by running "man gittutorial" in a terminal
(if you have the git manpages installed).  The gittutorial and its
follow-on documentation are also available online here:</p></div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_overview_of_the_process">5. Overview of the process</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The high-level overview of how to contribute changes to the source goes
like this:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Communicate with the project developers and let us know what you&#8217;re
  hacking on
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Clone the git repo
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Make your changes in a local branch, making sure you "sign off" your commits
  according to our signed-off-by policy (see below).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Adding documentation and tests is an important part of adding a new
  feature.  Otherwise, others won&#8217;t know how to use your feature, and
  if other changes break your feature it can go unnoticed without a test.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Share your changes with the other project developers in one of these ways:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Push your branch to github and create a github pull request to
   <a href="https://github.com/linuxcnc/linuxcnc">https://github.com/linuxcnc/linuxcnc</a> (this requires a github account)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Push your branch to a publicly visible git repo (such as github,
   bitbucket, your own publicly-accessible server, etc) and share that
   location on the emc-developers mailing list, or
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Email your commits to the emc-developers mailing list (use <code>git
   format-patch</code> to create the patches)
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Advocate for your patch
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Explain what problem it addresses and why it should be included
   in LinuxCNC
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Be receptive to questions and feedback from the developer community.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It is not uncommon for a patch to go through several revisions before
   it is accepted.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_git_configuration">6. git configuration</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>In order to be considered for inclusion in the LinuxCNC source, commits
must have correct Author fields identifying the author of the commit.
A good way to ensure this is to set your global git config:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>git config --global user.name "Your full name"</code></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>git config --global user.email "you@example.com"</code></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Use your real name (not a handle), and use an unobfuscated e-mail address.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_effective_use_of_git">7. Effective use of git</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_commit_contents">7.1. Commit contents</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Keep your commits small and to the point.  Each commit should accomplish
one logical change to the repo.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_write_good_commit_messages">7.2. Write good commit messages</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Keep commit messages around 72 columns wide (so that in a default-size
terminal window, they don&#8217;t wrap when shown by <code>git log</code>).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Use the first line as a summary of the intent of the change (almost
like the subject line of an e-mail).  Follow it with a blank line,
then a longer message explaining the change.  Example:</p></div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>Get rid of RTAPI_SUCCESS, use 0 instead</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>The test "retval &lt; 0" should feel familiar; it's the same kind of
test you use in userspace (returns -1 for error) and in kernel space
(returns -ERRNO for error)</code></pre>
</div></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_commit_to_the_proper_branch">7.3. Commit to the proper branch</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Bugfixes should go on the oldest applicable branch.  New features should
go in the master branch.  If you&#8217;re not sure where a change belongs,
ask on irc or on the mailing list.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_use_multiple_commits_to_organize_changes">7.4. Use multiple commits to organize changes</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When appropriate, organize your changes into a branch (a series of
commits) where each commit is a logical step towards your ultimate
goal. For example, first factor out some complex code into a new
function. Then, in a second commit, fix an underlying bug. Then, in the
third commit, add a new feature which is made easier by the refactoring
and which would not have worked without fixing that bug.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is helpful to reviewers, because it is easier to see that the
"factor out code into new function" step was right when there aren’t
other edits mixed in; it’s easier to see that the bug is fixed when
the change that fixes it is separate from the new feature; and so on.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_follow_the_style_of_the_surrounding_code">7.5. Follow the style of the surrounding code</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Make an effort to follow the prevailing indentation style of surrounding
code. In particular, changes to whitespace make it harder for other
developers to track changes over time. When reformatting code must be
done, do it as a commit separate from any semantic changes.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_simplify_complicated_history_before_sharing_with_fellow_developers">7.6. Simplify complicated history before sharing with fellow developers</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>With git, it’s possible to record every edit and false start as a
separate commit. This is very convenient as a way to create checkpoints
during development, but often you don’t want to share these false
starts with others.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Git provides two main ways to clean history, both of which can be done
freely before you share the change:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>git commit --amend</code> lets you make additional changes to the last thing
you committed, optionally modifying the commit message as well. Use this
if you realized right away that you left something out of the commit,
or if you typo’d the commit message.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>git rebase --interactive upstream-branch</code> lets you go back through each
commit made since you forked your feature branch from the upstream branch,
possibly editing commits, dropping commits, or squashing (combining)
commits with others.  Rebase can also be used to split individual commits
into multiple new commits.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_make_sure_every_commit_builds">7.7. Make sure every commit builds</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If your change consists of several patches, <code>git rebase -i</code> may be used to
reorder these patches into a sequence of commits which more clearly lays
out the steps of your work.  A potential consequence of reordering patches
is that one might get dependencies wrong - for instance, introducing a
use of a variable, and the declaration of that variable only follows in
a later patch.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>While the branch HEAD will build, not every commit might build in such
a case.  That breaks <code>git bisect</code> - something somebody else might use
later on to find the commit which introduced a bug.  So beyond making
sure your branch builds, it is important to assure every single commit
builds as well.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There&#8217;s an automatic way to check a branch for each commit being buildable
- see <a href="http://dustin.sallings.org/2010/03/28/git-test-sequence.html">http://dustin.sallings.org/2010/03/28/git-test-sequence.html</a>
, and the code at <a href="https://github.com/dustin/bindir/blob/master/git-test-sequence">https://github.com/dustin/bindir/blob/master/git-test-sequence</a> .
Use as follows (in this case testing every commit from origin/master to
HEAD, including running regression tests):</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>cd linuxcnc-dev
git-test-sequence origin/master..  '(cd src &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; ../scripts/runtests)'</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This will either report <em>All&#8217;s well</em> or <em>Broke on &lt;commit&gt;</em></p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_renaming_files">7.8. Renaming files</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Please use the ability to rename files very cautiously.  Like running
indent on single files, renames still make it more difficult to follow
changes over time.  At a minimum, you should seek consensus on irc or
the mailing list that the rename is an improvement.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_prefer_rebase">7.9. Prefer "rebase"</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Use <code>git pull --rebase</code> instead of bare <code>git pull</code> in order to keep a
nice linear history.  When you rebase, you always retain your work as
revisions that are ahead of origin/master, so you can do things like
<code>git format-patch</code> them to share with others without pushing to the
central repository.</p></div>
</div>
